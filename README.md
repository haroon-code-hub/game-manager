# 🎮 Game Manager

Game Manager is a **full-stack application** built to demonstrate clean separation between frontend and backend, scalable project structure, and practical backend–frontend integration. The project focuses on managing game-related data while leaving room for future expansion such as authentication, persistence, and analytics.

This repository serves both as a **learning project** and a **portfolio piece**, showcasing real-world development practices rather than a simple demo app.
